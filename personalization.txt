CHOICE POINT #1: COLOR THEME
Option Chosen: A
Explanation: I chose to keep it the same because it is a simple design that matches the school colors. It looks more professional as well, and I don't even have to change anything. It will also show my school spirit. I thought about choosing my own color theme, but it didn't look the best in my opinion.
